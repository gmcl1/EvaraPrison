Ideas
-------------------------

1)  Mine based enchants as well that use a different currency
    (enchantments but more like buffs to statistics, for example Enchant % Boost, Token % Boost and something along those lines ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

2) Robot
   have like tiers so that Tier 1 is basically like worst would be Stone Robot best would be Iron Robot or something
   Robot Containers, open them to receive robots for your mine.

ROBOTS

-------------------------

*   Robot Tiers
        Stone
        Coal
        Iron
        Lapis
        Redstone
        Gold
        Diamond
        Emerald
        Bedrock

*   Upgrade by merging
        Stone + Stone Robots -> Coal Robot
        Coal + Coal Robots -> Iron Robot
        Iron + Iron Robots -> Gold Robot
        Gold + Gold Robots -> Diamond Robot
        Diamond + Diamond Robots -> Emerald Robot
        Emerald + Emerald Robots -> Ruby Robot

*   Another thing for rank perks we could add is you usually need
    to click on individual robots to collect the beacons it has generated but if you have a rank you can just click on a nether star
    or something (where the name tag is currently placed in the gui) and it collects all of them at once, just a QOL thing
